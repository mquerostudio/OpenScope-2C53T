# EXP-63 — timebase codes 0x0A–0x0C and 0x06–0x09, with a source that can reach them

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Unit:** bench unit #3 (V1.4). The rate table being tested is unit #1's.
- **Build:** unit #3 on PR #48's branch (`feat/usb-wedge-evidence` @ `f912890` = #41 + the evidence record; no
  timebase or acquisition change vs #41), `Build: Oct  1 2026 14:36:14`. Scripts at `bench/signal-source-abstraction`
  @ `66a1802`. Source: `kodedot_sigsource` on a Kode Dot (ESP32-P4), standalone, output GPIO9 (§3).
- **Status:** **CONFIRMED** — H1 confirmed at 0x0C/0x0B/0x0A; H2 = O1 (the instrument, not the device) at 0x08 and 0x09; 0x07/0x06 fitted beyond the plan, PROVISIONAL. Pre-registered before any capture; thresholds unchanged.

## 1. Problem
Eight of 21 timebase codes have a rate (0x0D–0x14, 500 S/s – ~124 kS/s). `0x0A`–`0x0C` have none because
the ESP32 source topped out near 4.5 kHz and its tones landed in bins 1–15: a limit of the instrument,
not evidence about the device (`scope_timebase.c`, EXP-18 §6). `0x06`–`0x09` are INCOHERENT (EXP-12,
EXP-15), but EXP-15 only read them through `spi3 opread`; its §6 says the acq path "was not tried".
**Which sample rates do 0x0A–0x0C select, and were 0x06–0x09 incoherent in the device or in our
instrument?** (README §3, "what is still open".)

## 2. Hypotheses
**H1 — the ladder continues.** `0x0C`/`0x0B`/`0x0A` = 250 k / 500 k / 1.25 M S/s (×2, ×2, ×2.5 from `0x0D`,
the 2.5/2/2 cadence of 500 → 1250 → 2500 → 5000). One-tone form: a 25 kHz square at `0x0C` lands at bin
1024·25000/250000 = **102.4** (accept 101–104, ±2%). It must beat: uniform ×2 (`0x0A` = 1.0 MS/s, a
250 kHz tone at bin 256 instead of 204.8), saturation (one fit at every code, EXP-15's symptom), and no
rate at all. Verdict per code, read against the per-tone table and not the printed label (EXP-15 §5a):

| outcome | rule |
|---|---|
| H1 confirmed | R² ≥ 0.99, no tone with read-to-read spread > 20 bins, fold worst miss ≤ 12 bins, fs within ±2% of prediction |
| H1 refuted, rate measured | those three coherence tests pass but fs is > 2% off the ladder: the number is the finding |
| no rate (NOT a refutation) | a coherence test fails: peak bin matches no ladder rate, or the fold fails. Code stays `0.0f` |

Scale-free ladder shape, ±3% each: fs(0x0C)/fs(0x0D) = 2, fs(0x0B)/fs(0x0C) = 2, fs(0x0A)/fs(0x0B) = 2.5.

**H2 — `0x06`–`0x09` were incoherent in the instrument, not the device.** Run 3 reads each code through
both paths with identical tones, unit, build and source, so the read path is the only difference between
its two columns. **O1:** acq coherent (R² ≥ 0.99, no `!!` line) with a different fs per code while opread
scatters: EXP-15 was the read path. **O2:** acq coherent but one fs for all four (~1.25 kS/s): the codes do
not select distinct rates, a device property, instrument excluded. **O3:** acq as scattered as opread:
EXP-15 survives a new path, source, unit and build. Run 3's tones (40–420 Hz) can only see fs ≲ 20 kS/s;
if the ladder continued up (0x09 = 2.5 M, 0x08 = 5 M) they sit below bin 1 and O3 is expected. Run 4
therefore places tones for 5 MS/s. Prediction: **acq R² ≥ 0.99, fs within ±2% of 5.0 M, fold ≤ 12 bins.**
Falsifier: scatter > 20 bins on acq at both placements. Opread is expected torn at 5 MS/s (EXP-10); in
run 4 its column is the contrast, not a test.

## 3. Procedure
**Deviations from the pre-registration (2026-10-01, before any run):**
- Source pin is **GPIO9** (EXP2, J3 pin 4), not GPIO14: the operator's probes were already there. GPIO9 sits behind the ESDA6V1SC6 array (~190 pF) with the 68 Ω series resistor (τ ≈ 13 ns), which rounds MHz edges; the fits use the fundamental's peak bin, so the edges do not matter for the rates, but the fold tones above ~1 MHz lose harmonic content. `kodedot_sigsource` was changed to make GPIO9 its default output (`p 14` / `p 21` still select the low-capacitance pins).
- The Dot runs `kodedot_sigsource` **standalone** (its flash was rewritten with the operator's consent: no kodeOS on this unit, no panel assembly, no KTD2026 LED). The SDK's LED driver retried every 40 ms and logged each attempt on the console, so (a) that log is silenced in the app and (b) `bench._DotSerialTransport` now reads replies to the `>ok`/`>err` terminator instead of quiet time (commit 66a1802).
- **CH1 is the crocodile-clip lead** (no attenuator, ×1 by construction) for every run below; the operator's ×1 probe does not conduct. Shown before run 1, with the Dot's square on GPIO9 at 0x10, range 6: the lead's channel saw 86–89 codes p-p at 1000 Hz, the probe's channel 2–4 codes (noise) through (a) a static `dc 0`/`dc 1` step (lead: 141 → 225 codes; probe: 81.3 → 81.3), (b) a pin finder — the app was extended to drive any of the 14 J3 GPIOs (`p <gpio>`) and the square was walked over all of them: only GPIO9 moved the lead's channel, nothing moved the probe's — and (c) swapping the two BNCs at the scope: the square followed the lead to CH1 and the probe stayed flat on CH2. CH1's input itself is fine (at range 0 it picks up 50 Hz, 22× the floor, as an open high-impedance input does; after the swap it shows the square). The lead is on GPIO9, its ground clip on the GND pair beside GPIO14/GPIO21. CH2 (dead probe) is set to the same range and ignored.
- `ppm 35` is set by hand after each Dot reset (not persisted).

**Preconditions verified by readback** (not assumed):

| `version` (the `build:` line, all four runs) | one string, recorded | `OpenScope 2C53T | Build: Oct  1 2026 14:36:14 | MCU: AT32F403A @ 240MHz | SRAM: 224KB (EOPB0=0xFE)` (runs 1, 2) |

python3 scripts/measure_sample_rate.py --source kodedot --codes 0x0F 0x0E 0x0D                    # run 1

```
Each run starts with the 0x10 two-path control (unless `--no-control`), sets range 6 on both channels and
ends with the Dot clock check. Run 1 first; runs 2–4 only if run 1's controls pass. Tones sit at
1/2/5/10/20% of the expected rate (taken from the script's own functions, no device touched). The fit uses
the Dot's reported Hz. Only CH1 is read.

| code | fit tones (Hz) | predicted bins (N=1024) | fold tones (0.62–1.71 × fitted fs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x0F / 0x0E / 0x0D | 250…5000 / 500…10000 / 1200…25000 | 10–205 on all three | 15–43 k / 31–85 k / 77–210 k |

| 0x06–0x09, run 3 | 40 80 130 200 300 420 (EXP-12/15 set, for comparability) | < 1 if fs ≥ 2.5 M | n/a |
| 0x08, run 4 | 50 k 100 k 250 k 500 k 1 M | 10.2 20.5 51.2 102.4 204.8 | ~3.1–8.6 MHz |

No firmware or table change here. A later `scope_timebase.c` edit writes the fitted value, never the round one.

## 4. Control
Record before section 5; same session, same path as the new codes. 1% is about twice the one cross-unit
gap on record (0x10 vs Stlkv's rig, 0.43%). Integer-bin quantisation alone gives ~0.1% rms (0.3% worst).

| control | expected | measured | passed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x10 opread vs acq (script's own check) | agree < 5%, `PASS` | run 1: 12489 / 12489 S/s, `paths agree to 0.0%  PASS` | yes |
| 0x10, each path vs table 12,490.0 | within 1% | 12489 S/s both paths: −0.01% | yes |
| 0x0F vs table 24,979.1 | within 1% | 25009 S/s: +0.12% | yes |
| 0x0E vs table 49,930.1 | within 1% | 50020 S/s: +0.18% | yes |
| 0x0D vs table 123,662.7 (PROVISIONAL, −1.07% from round 125 k) | within 1.5%; ~125,000 passes | 124968 S/s: +1.06% vs the table, −0.03% vs round 125 k | yes |
| fold at 0x0F / 0x0E / 0x0D | worst miss ≤ 12 bins | 1 / 1 / 1 bins | yes |
| closing `source at end` clock check | `PASS` | `Kode Dot clk 80000000 Hz … PASS` (run 1) | yes |

Runs 2–4 repeat the 0x10 control at their start; if it fails, that run is **VOID, not negative**. A 0x0D
miss beyond 1.5% voids runs 2–4: it is the nearest known code and uses the method the new codes use.
H2's own control is the opread/acq contrast under identical conditions.

Ladder shape (±3% allowed): fs(0x0C)/fs(0x0D) = 250,089/124,968 = **2.001**; fs(0x0B)/fs(0x0C) = **2.000**; fs(0x0A)/fs(0x0B) = **2.498**. The 2.5/2/2 cadence continues to 1.25 MS/s. Every fit is a distinct rate per code (not EXP-15's one-value symptom), the folds hold through 2.1 MHz through the 68 Ω + ~190 pF of GPIO9, and no fit sits near 1/3 of its prediction (the harmonic trap in §6).

Verdict against §2 H2: **O3** on both paths at this tone placement — opread R² 0.43–0.80 with read-to-read spreads up to 460 bins, acq with 0–1 usable points (every tone's three reads disagree by 24–394 bins), every fold fails. This is the outcome the pre-registration said to *expect* if the ladder continues above 1.25 MS/s: at 2.5–25 MS/s a 1024-sample record spans 41–410 µs, a fraction of one 40–420 Hz period, so each record is a different slice of a near-DC level and no bin reproduces. It therefore says nothing yet about H2's O1/O2 — run 4 places the tones for 5 MS/s. Control at the start of this run: opread 12519 / acq 12489 S/s (0.2% apart, 3500 Hz read at bin 286 vs 287), PASS.

Verdict against §2 H2: **O1.** The acq path is coherent — fs = **4,990,070 S/s** (−0.20% of 5.0 M; prediction ±2%), R² 1.0000, tones at bins 11/21/51/103/205 against 10.2/20.5/51.2/102.4/204.8, no `!!` line, fold worst miss 3 bins through 8.5 MHz — while opread on the same code, unit, build, source and tones is torn (R² −0.22, every tone off by 30–200 bins, fold fails), as EXP-10 found for opread at high rates. The read path is the only difference between the two columns, so EXP-12/15's "incoherent" 0x06–0x09 was the instrument. Ladder: fs(0x08)/fs(0x0A) = 4,990,070/1,249,691 = **3.993** (×2 ×2 ✓ via 0x09, measured in run 5).

### Run 5a — 0x09 with tones placed for 2.5 MS/s, both paths (`dumps/exp63_run5a.log`, unedited)
Beyond the pre-registration (which placed only 0x08); same rules as run 4, placement from the ladder (2.5 M).

- 0x07: fs = **12,498,676 S/s** (−0.01% of 12.5 M), R² 0.9996. Per tone, the implied rate (f·1024/bin) is 13.7 / **11.1** / 12.7 / 12.3 / 12.5 MS/s: the 250 kHz tone sits at bin 23 where 20.5 was predicted (−11%); the other four are within quantisation. No `!!` line: the three reads of each tone agreed.
- 0x06: fs = **24,849,896 S/s** (−0.60% of 25 M), R² 0.9973. Implied rate per tone 19.7 / 19.7 / 24.1 / 23.9 / 25.2 MS/s: the two lowest tones (250 k, 500 k: bins 13 and 26 against 10.2 and 20.5) land ~20% high, reproducibly; the top three agree with 25 M. The slope fit is carried by the high tones.
- **Tier decision, naming the override:** §2's "no rate" clause reads "a coherence test fails: peak bin matches no ladder rate". Taken literally, 0x06's two lowest tones (bins 13 and 26, implying ~19.7 MS/s) match no ladder rate and the code would stay 0.0f. It is entered as PROVISIONAL instead, on the 0x0D precedent (EXP-18 entered 0x0D as "a direction" with its two lowest tones in bins 1 and 3, R² 0.947) and because the three tones ≥ 1.2 MHz, the slope fit and the ladder agree within 0.6%; the marker (`~`) is what PROVISIONAL exists for. The same clause applies to 0x07's single outlier (bin 23 vs 20.5). A reader who holds to the letter of §2 should read both rows as 0.0f — the fitted numbers and the per-tone bins are all here for that.
- Both are entered as **PROVISIONAL**: fitted (R² ≥ 0.99, within 2% of the ladder) but not fold-checked, and with a reproducible low-tone deviation that this run cannot explain — the record at these rates spans 41–82 µs, i.e. 10–40 periods of the offending tones, so it is not a resolution problem. Candidates: a record that is not one contiguous 1024-sample capture at these codes (two segments, a held tail), or a frontend effect; to be tested with tones ≥ 1 MHz only and a source that reaches the fold band.

### Run 2, first attempt — aborted by the instrument, not the device
`fpga scope center ch1 6` answered nothing within the script's 20 s (`got 25 bytes`); by hand the same command completed in **20.4 s** (`CH1 range 6: center DAC1=2639 (median=128)`), so run 1 had passed the same step with < 0.4 s to spare. The scope's shell and protocol answered normally afterwards (`usbstat`: no stall; `dropped_closed=4` = the lines the device printed after the script had closed the port). Timeout raised to 60 s in both bench scripts; run 2 repeated from the start, controls included.

- Every control passes (§4). 0x0D fits 124,968 S/s: the table's PROVISIONAL 123,662.7 is 1.06% low and the round 125,000 is within 0.03%, on a second unit and a second source (EXP-18 measured it on unit #1 with the ESP32 sketch).

## 6. Blind spots
- **One unit, one session.** Unit #3 against unit #1's table; a 1% control miss could be unit-to-unit
  clock spread, not method. Nothing here speaks for other boards.
- **Square-wave harmonics.** The script does **not** use `window_for`; it takes a global top-1
  `peaks(v, 1)` over bins 1–512. The 3rd harmonic of a 50% square is 1/3 of the fundamental (−9.5 dB)
  and sits at 3f (folded to fs−3f past fs/2), so it cannot win, and it shares the fundamental's bin only
  at fs/4, beyond the tones (≤ 0.2 fs). The 9th harmonic of a 0.2 fs tone does alias onto the fundamental's
  bin: ≤ 11% magnitude, no bin shift. `window_for` (±25% + 2 bins) would exclude both, but it would make
  H1 partly self-fulfilling and park a ×2-uniform `0x0A` (+25%) on its edge, so it is a post-hoc
  `band_peak` diagnostic for bad fits only. Watch for a fit at ~1/3 of the predicted rate.
- **Crystal.** The Dot's X1 is ~+35 ppm fast, uncorrected; the scope's own clock is unmeasured. Both are
  < 0.004%, 30× below fit resolution. No absolute claim finer than ~0.3%.
- **Aliasing.** Fit tones stay ≤ 0.2 fs of the *predicted* rate (≤ 0.4 fs if the rate is half). A rate
  below ~0.4× the prediction aliases them and reads as INCOHERENT, not as a rate. Fold tones are placed
  from the *fitted* rate, so a wrong fit moves its own test, and the fold output prints no magnitude:
  a miss on the highest tones is weak evidence.
- **Acq path above 124 kS/s is extrapolated.** The control proves it only up to 0x0D. Snapshot and
  hold behaviour at 250 k–1.25 MS/s is assumed.
- **Dithered tones.** Several auto-placed tones (62 k, 120 k, most fold tones > 300 kHz) are `dithered` per
  `plan_table`: ≤ 250 ppm off, period jitter ≤ 12.5 ns, reported Hz = long-run average. Harmless to a bin;
  if a fit is marginal, rerun with `--tones` at 2^a·5^b values.
- **Probe loading.** Two ×1 probes on one pin (68 Ω series) round MHz edges and cut amplitude. That cannot
  move a peak bin; it can only sink a weak fold tone into the noise.
- **No two-shapes control.** One pin feeds both channels, so a readout that mirrored CH1 into CH2 would
  not be caught. Only CH1 is read: CH2's timebase is assumed, not tested.
- **reg 0x01 is not read back between codes.** `sc.timebase()` discards the reply, including `reg 0x01
  NOT written`. The in-data guard is distinct fits per code; one value everywhere is EXP-15's symptom.
- Run 4 tests one rate for one code (0x09 = 2.5 M, 0x07 = 12.5 M, 0x06 = 25 M need their own runs).

## 7. Conclusion
Measured ladder, unit #3, acq path, Kode Dot source (crystal-derived frequencies), 1024-sample records:

| code | fs (S/s) | vs 2.5/2/2 ladder | R² | fold | tier |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 0x10 (control) | 12,489 | −0.01% vs table 12,490.0 | 1.0000 | — | (unit #1's MEASURED, confirmed) |
| 0x0F (control) | 25,009 | +0.12% vs table | 1.0000 | 1 bin | (confirmed) |
| 0x0E (control) | 50,020 | +0.18% vs table | 1.0000 | 1 bin | (confirmed) |
| 0x0D | 124,968 | −0.03% vs 125 k (+1.06% vs the provisional table) | 1.0000 | 1 bin | MEASURED |
| 0x0C | 250,089 | +0.04% | 1.0000 | 1 bin | MEASURED |

| 0x08 | 4,990,070 | −0.20% | 1.0000 | 3 bins | MEASURED |
| 0x07 | 12,498,676 | −0.01% | 0.9996 | not possible (> 10 MHz) | PROVISIONAL |
| 0x06 | 24,849,896 | −0.60% | 0.9973 | not possible | PROVISIONAL (two low tones ~20% off) |

- **Established:** (H1) `0x0C`/`0x0B`/`0x0A` select 250 k / 500 k / 1.25 M S/s within 0.04%, every coherence test passing; the 2.5/2/2 cadence continues from 0x0D to 0x08 with every step within 0.3% (ratios 2.001, 2.000, 2.498, 2.001, 1.995). (H2 = O1) `0x08` and `0x09` are coherent on the acq path — distinct rates, R² 1.0000, folds within 3 bins through 8.5 MHz — while opread on the same code, unit, build, source and tones is torn: EXP-12/15's INCOHERENT band was the opread instrument at those rates, not the device. The acq path is validated to 5 MS/s by fold tests (the §6 extrapolation is closed up to 0x08). Cross-unit: unit #3 reproduces unit #1's 0x0E–0x10 within 0.18%, so unit #1's table and these numbers can share one ladder at this resolution.
- **Excluded:** uniform ×2 above 0x0D (0x0A would be 1.0 MS/s: its 250 kHz tone sits at bin 205, not 256); saturation (one rate for all codes); "no rate at all" for 0x06–0x0C; the device as the cause of EXP-15's incoherence at 0x08/0x09.
- **NOT excluded (explicitly):** that 0x07/0x06 are exactly 12.5 M / 25 M (fitted, not fold-checked, and their lowest tones land 11–20% high for a reason this run cannot name); anything about 0x00–0x05; that unit #1 would give these exact numbers above 0x0D (0.2% unit spread is the one cross-check); the mechanism by which opread tears (Stlkv's #18 hypothesis stays open); CH2's timebase (never read).
- **Follow-up:** write these rates into `scope_timebase.c` with tiers as above and provenance "unit #3, EXP-63" (done in this branch, separate commit); re-measure 0x07/0x06 with fit tones ≥ 1 MHz and a source that reaches 43 MHz for the fold; 0x05–0x00 (50 M – 250 M by the ladder) need that source too; run the opread path at 0x08 with a logic analyser on SPI3 to settle the tearing mechanism; EXP-64 (vertical) once a second working input lead is on hand.
