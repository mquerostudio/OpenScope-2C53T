"""Run every flash-safety / firmware test suite and report skips loudly.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-11 a review reported "49 tests pass" as a clean result. Five tests
had been skipped because local artifacts were missing, and one of them was
test_updater_binaries_gap_fill_stock_settings_page -- the only test in the
whole suite that inspects a real built binary rather than the text of a source
file. The single highest-value check was silently absent from the number that
was used to approve the change.

`unittest` prints skips as a quiet "(skipped=5)" suffix that reads like a
footnote. This runner makes them impossible to miss, names each one, and can
fail outright on them, so "everything passed" cannot quietly mean "everything
that ran passed".

Usage:
  python3 scripts/run_tests.py             # run all, report skips prominently
  python3 scripts/run_tests.py --strict    # exit non-zero if anything skipped
  python3 scripts/run_tests.py -k iap      # only suites matching a substring

# test_firmware_build.py is last because it is by far the slowest (~15 s; it
# compiles five targets from clean) and because a source-level failure is
# usually easier to read after the cheap text checks have had their say. It is
# also the only suite that runs a compiler over firmware/src at all -- until it
# was added on 2026-08-13, a green gate was compatible with firmware that did
# not build. See its module docstring.
