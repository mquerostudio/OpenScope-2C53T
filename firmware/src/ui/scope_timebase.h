/*
 * OpenScope 2C53T — horizontal (time) calibration
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * One number per reg-0x01 timebase code: the capture sample rate in samples
 * per second. Everything horizontal the instrument could claim — seconds per
 * division, frequency, period, rise time — is derived from that rate and a
 * sample count. There is nothing else in the horizontal path.
 *
 * This is the exact counterpart of scope_cal.h for the vertical axis, and it
 * is deliberately built the same way, including the tiers and the refusal to
 * print when there is no entry.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
 * ---------------------------
 * docs/experiments/2026-08-18-10-time-axis.md (the ladder) and
 * docs/experiments/2026-08-18-12-code-08-incoherent.md (what a rate must
 * survive before it is believed), bench unit #1.
 *
 * Method: drive tones of known frequency, find the spectral peak with a
 * SEARCH, and fit peak-bin against frequency through the origin —
 * bin = f * 1024/fs, so fs = 1024/slope.
 *
 * "KNOWN FREQUENCY" IS AN ASSUMPTION, AND IT WAS WRONG UNTIL 2026-08-19
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every rate in the first version of this file was 1.21x too high. The fits
 * used the frequency ASKED FOR from the ESP32 source; the source delivered
 * 0.8250x that, because its DDS loop reschedules from `now` after the work is
 * already done, so its period is whatever two dacWrite() calls cost — 32,999
 * S/s against an assumed 40,000. Nothing in the fit could see it: a
 * multiplicative error in the source is a multiplicative error in fs, with the
 * R^2, the linearity and the fold test all untouched.
 *
 * What caught it was somebody else's number. Stlkv's independent 2C23T-port
 * rig reported rates a consistent ~1.2x BELOW ours, with the ratios between
 * codes agreeing perfectly — the exact signature of a scale error in one of
 * the two sources. The generator now measures its own loop against the ESP32
 * crystal and reports it (`fs` / `usefs` in esp32_siggen.ino), and the
 * corrected 0x10 lands 1.1% from Stlkv's figure.
 *
 * The rule this leaves behind: a source is an instrument, and an instrument
 * that has never been checked against anything is not a reference. See
 * docs/experiments/2026-08-19-14-siggen-sample-rate.md.
 *
 * AN R^2 IS NOT ENOUGH, AND THAT IS NOT A THEORETICAL WORRY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * At code 0x08 a 14-tone in-band sweep returned **R^2 = 0.9304** — which reads
 * as a decent fit — on a record that does not reproduce itself between reads.
 * Three consecutive reads of one unchanged tone gave peak bins [171, 132, 104],
 * and two passes of the identical sweep disagreed by 7.6%.
 *
 * What exposed it is the FOLD test: above Nyquist a tone aliases to
 * |f - round(f/fs)*fs|, a bin position far more sensitive to fs than the
 * in-band slope is. A line through noise that happens to trend passes the R^2
 * test and fails this one. At 0x08 the fitted rate missed its own fold
 * predictions by up to 227 bins; at 0x10, where fs is independently known, the
 * same test missed by at most 8.
 *
 * So a rate reaches MEASURED here only if it has survived the fold test, and
 * `scripts/measure_sample_rate.py` runs that check as part of the measurement.
 *
 * THE TIERS
 * ---------
 *   MEASURED     0x0E / 0x0F / 0x10. In-band R^2 of 0.99 or better against a
 *                source whose own rate was measured in the same channel
 *                configuration the sweep ran in, and confirmed stable to
 *                0.01% across the run. 0x10 additionally passes the fold test
 *                (worst miss 5.3 bins over five above-Nyquist tones, against
 *                142 bins for the pre-correction rate) and agrees with an
 *                independent rig to 1.1%.
 *
 *                Run-to-run spread is 0.02% at 0x10 but 3.5-4.8% at 0x0D-0x0F,
 *                where our source's 4.5 kHz ceiling puts the tones in low bins
 *                and quantisation dominates. Treat those three as +/-5%.
 *   PROVISIONAL  0x0D. R^2 0.947, and the two lowest tones land in bins 1 and
 *                3, which is not a measurement so much as a direction.
 *   NONE         everything else, for two DIFFERENT reasons that must not be
 *                conflated:
 *                  - 0x0A / 0x0B / 0x0C: not measurable with our current
 *                    source. It tops out near 4.5 kHz, which at 300 kS/s is
 *                    bin 15 and at 600 kS/s is bin 7, so the fit measures
 *                    quantisation. The device is probably fine here; our
 *                    instrument is not. A faster generator settles it.
 *                  - 0x08: measured and found INCOHERENT. Reads do not
 *                    reproduce. This is a statement about the device.
 *                  - all other codes: never measured at all.
 *
 * UPDATED 2026-10-01 (EXP-63, unit #3, Kode Dot source, acq path): MEASURED
 * now also covers 0x08-0x0D (R^2 1.0000, fold-tested, 0x08 through 8.5 MHz);
 * PROVISIONAL is 0x07 and 0x06 (fitted within 0.6% of the ladder, R^2 >=
 * 0.997, but the fold band is above the source's 10 MHz and 0x06's two lowest
 * tones sit ~20% high); NONE is 0x00-0x05, never measured. The 0x08
 * INCOHERENT verdict above was the opread read path, not the device: the same
 * run read 0x08 through opread and acq and only opread tore. The text above
 * is kept as the record of how that was found out.
 *
 * A NONE entry returns 0.0f and callers MUST fall back to samples — the same
 * contract scope_cal.h imposes for counts. Printing a frequency derived from
 * an assumed rate is exactly the invention this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * SECONDS PER DIVISION IS A PROPERTY OF OUR RENDERER, NOT OF THE HARDWARE
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * scope_ui.c draws one sample per screen column and rules a vertical grid line
 * every 32 px, so a division is 32 samples and s/div = 32/fs. That is what our
 * grid means, and the label must say so.
 *
 * Worth recording, because it is a genuinely different situation from the
 * volts case: the nominal `timebase_table` labels ("5ns" ... "20ms") are a
 * CONSTANT factor away from that on every code we have measured. Before the
 * 2026-08-19 source correction that factor read as 2.12-2.15x; with the
 * corrected rates it is 2.51-2.56x, i.e. the nominal labels are almost exactly
 * 2.5x our s/div. Unlike `vdiv_table` — which was 2.7-3.5x out with NO
 * consistent factor and was simply invented — this table is evidently real and
 * describes a renderer that draws a different number of samples per division
 * than ours does. That is a fact about STOCK's geometry, not a defect in ours.
 * If the renderer's geometry is ever changed, change
 * SCOPE_TIMEBASE_SAMPLES_PER_DIV with it and the labels follow.
 *
 * A NOTE ON THE ROUND NUMBERS
 * ---------------------------
 * The measured ladder is very close to 12.5k / 25k / 50k / 125k S/s — a clean
 * 1-2-5 sequence — and Stlkv's independent rig reports 12,437 / 25,000 /
 * 125,000. The round values sit inside our run-to-run spread on every code, so
 * they are probably the truth. They are deliberately NOT written into the
 * table: what is stored is what was measured. Rounding measurements toward the
 * answer we expect is how a table stops being evidence.
