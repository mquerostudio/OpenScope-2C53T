 *
 * RESCALED 2026-08-19 (EXP-14). Every rate here was previously 1.21x too high,
 * because the fits used the frequency COMMANDED from the ESP32 source while the
 * source delivered 0.8250x that. Its DDS loop reschedules from `now` after the
 * work is done, so its real rate is whatever two dacWrite() calls cost — 32,999
 * Hz against an assumed 40,000, measured against the ESP32's own crystal. The
 * generator now measures and reports its loop rate, and the fits divide by the
 * measured value. Consequences worth keeping in mind:
 *
 *   - the error was purely multiplicative, so the 1-2-5 SHAPE of this ladder,
 *     every R^2, and every fold check were untouched. Only the scale moved.
 *   - the corrected 0x10 lands 1.1% from Stlkv's independent figure (12,437),
 *     measured on a different unit with a different generator and a completely
 *     different method. That is this project's first cross-rig agreement on an
 *     ABSOLUTE quantity.
 *   - the round 1-2-5 ladder 12.5k / 25k / 50k / 125k sits inside our
 *     run-to-run spread on all four codes and is very likely the truth, but it
 *     is NOT written here. These are the measurements; fitting them to the
 *     round numbers we suspect would be inventing data.
 *
 * The AMPLITUDE calibration in scope_cal.c is untouched by this — the loop-rate
 * error moves frequency only. Absolute volts remain unverified.
 *
 * WITHDRAWN 2026-08-18 (EXP-12): code 0x08 was published at 1.07 kS/s, then at
 * 1,660 S/s (EXP-10), then fitted at 1,414 and 1,526 S/s in two passes minutes
 * apart. All are artifacts. The record at 0x08 does not reproduce between
 * reads — one unchanged tone gave peak bins [171, 132, 104] — and the fitted
 * rate missed its own fold predictions by up to 227 bins. It is entered here
 * as 0.0f, and the reason is INCOHERENT rather than UNMEASURED.

 * REVISED 2026-08-19 (EXP-17). The three measured rates moved by +1.78% /
 * -2.94% / -0.68%. The revision came out of validating the frequency
 * estimator, not out of looking for it: applied to a KNOWN drive, the
 * estimator's error was not scattered, it was constant within each timebase
 * code and different BETWEEN codes.
 *
 * That pattern is what assigns blame. A source-scale error -- the EXP-14 bug,
 * where the generator delivered 0.825x what it was told -- multiplies every
 * commanded frequency by one factor, so it moves every code the same
 * direction by the same amount. Here 0x0E needed +1.8% and 0x0F needed -2.9%,
 * opposite signs, which no single source factor can produce. And within one
 * code the error held constant from bin 6.8 to bin 246, a 36:1 span, so it is
 * not an interpolation artifact either (that varies with fractional bin).
 *
 * Method: 66 records (two ranges, five drive frequencies, two reps), peak
 * located by the shipped estimator, then fs from a least-squares fit of bin
 * against drive frequency. The fit is deliberately free-intercept rather than
 * through the origin, because the intercept turns out to be real: -0.045 bins,
 * the SAME on all three codes, a small fixed bias in parabolic interpolation
 * over a Hanning magnitude spectrum. It is worth only 0.03-0.11% here, but
 * fitting through the origin would have folded it into the slope.
 *
 * Four checks, all independent of the fit itself:
 *   - two DISJOINT drive sets (100/250/500/1000/2000 and 150/330/700/1500/
 *     3000 Hz) agree to 0.00%, 0.03% and 0.24%;
 *   - all three land within 0.14% of the round 1-2-5 ladder 12.5k/25k/50k;
 *   - averaging per-point ratios instead of fitting agrees to 0.11%;
 *   - 0x10 against Stlkv's independent rig (12,437 S/s, different unit,
 *     generator, firmware and method) improves from +1.11% to +0.43%.
 *
 * The last one is the one that matters: it is out-of-sample. Nothing in this
 * fit knows about his number, and the correction moved toward it.
 *
 * The round ladder is STILL NOT WRITTEN HERE, for the reason it was not
 * written in EXP-14: 12,490 is what was measured and 12,500 is what was
 * expected, and a table that records expectations is not evidence. The
 * agreement is now close enough that the ladder is almost certainly the
 * design intent -- but "almost certainly" belongs in a comment, not in a
 * float that later work will treat as data.
 *
 * Why the first ladder was wrong is NOT established. The leading candidate is
 * that it was fitted partly on torn records: it swept through `spi3 opread`,
 * whose ~17.5 ms /256 burst lets the engine lap the buffer, and which still
 * tears 6 reads in 12 (EXP-16). This fit used `spi3 read`, which after the
 * 2026-08-19 snapshot fix tears 0 in 12. That is a plausible mechanism and
 * nothing more; it has not been tested by re-fitting the old data.
 *
 * 0x0D (119,678 S/s) was NOT re-measured -- the bench source cannot reach far
 * enough above it to place a peak usefully. It very likely carries a similar
 * error and stays PROVISIONAL.
 */

/*
 * EXTENDED 2026-08-19 (EXP-18). The calibrated ladder went from 4 codes to 8.
 *
 * Codes 0x11-0x14 had never been swept. Every earlier session worked downward
 * from 0x10 and treated the unmeasured codes as a block, but the ones ABOVE
 * 0x10 are SLOWER, which makes them EASIER to measure than anything already
 * done -- more cycles per record, higher bins, better resolved. They were not
 * hard. Nobody had looked.
 *
 *   0x11  4,990.8   R2 1.0000
 *   0x12  2,494.9   R2 1.0000, fold-tested
 *   0x13  1,250.4   R2 1.0000
 *   0x14    500.2   R2 1.0000
 *
 * THE LADDER IS 1-2.5-5, NOT UNIFORM x2. Predicted 6,250 for 0x11 by assuming
 * each step doubles; measured 4,990.8. The real sequence is
 * 500 / 1250 / 2500 / 5000 / 12500 / 25000 / 50000 / 125000 -- ratios
 * 2.5, 2, 2, 2.5, 2, 2, 2.5. Every measured code lands within 0.2% of it,
 * except 0x0D (see below). Prediction beaten by measurement, again, and in
 * the direction that matters: the wrong prediction was the round-looking one.
 *
 * FOLD TEST at 0x12 (Nyquist 1,247 Hz): five tones from 1.4 to 3.0 kHz land
 * where 2,494.9 S/s says they alias to, worst miss 2.4 bins of 512. Aliasing
 * depends only on f/fs, so this is scale-invariant -- it tests the rate, not
 * the arithmetic that produced it.
 *
 * 0x0D RE-MEASURED, and it is the first evidence for EXP-17's untested
 * mechanism. The old 119,678 came from a sweep through `spi3 opread`, whose
 * slow /256 burst lets the engine lap the buffer (6 reads in 12 torn). Read
 * instead through `spi3 read` -- 0 in 12 torn since the snapshot fix -- the
 * same code gives 123,662.7 with R2 going 0.947 -> 0.9997, and its distance
 * from the round 125,000 drops from -4.26% to -1.07%. EXP-17 could only offer
 * torn records as a plausible story; this is a controlled-ish test of it (same
 * code, same rig, different read path) and it went the predicted way.
 *
 * It stays PROVISIONAL regardless: at ~124 kS/s the bench source only reaches
 * bin 25, so this is the least-resolved code in the table and -1.07% is a
 * bigger miss than every other code by a factor of five.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED 2026-10-01 (EXP-63): the INCOHERENT band was the opread read
 * path, not the device; see EXTENDED 2026-10-01 below. Kept as written:
 *
 * NOT CHASED, worth recording: the INCOHERENT band 0x06-0x09 fitted to
 * 1,231 / 1,595 / 1,350 / 1,550 S/s -- all close to 0x13's 1,250. If the rate
 * field is narrower than the codes we write, or those codes select roll mode
 * rather than a rate, that would explain both the clustering and why the
 * numbers do not reproduce. Untested.

 *   0x06 24,849,896   R2 0.9973, no fold; the 250 k and 500 k   PROVISIONAL
 *                     tones land ~20% high, reproducibly, unexplained
 *
 * 0x07 / 0x06 ARE PROVISIONAL BY PRECEDENT, NOT BY THE LETTER of EXP-63's
 * pre-registered rules: a tone whose peak bin matches no ladder rate was to
 * leave the code at 0.0f, and 0x06's 250 k / 500 k tones (bins 13 / 26,
 * ~19.7 MS/s implied) do exactly that. They are entered the way 0x0D was in
 * EXP-18 (two tones in bins 1 and 3, "a direction"): the >= 1.2 MHz tones,
 * the slope and the ladder agree within 0.6%, and the ~ marker says the rest.
 * Anyone who prefers the letter of the rule should treat both rows as 0.0f.
 *
 * THE 2.5/2/2 CADENCE CONTINUES: ratios 0x0D->0x08 are 2.001, 2.000, 2.498,
 * 2.001, 1.995. Controls on unit #3 reproduce unit #1's 0x10 / 0x0F / 0x0E
 * within 0.01% / 0.12% / 0.18%, which is why one table holds both units.
 *
 * 0x08 AND 0x09 WERE NEVER INCOHERENT IN THE DEVICE. Read through acq with
 * tones placed for their real rate they are as clean as 0x10; read through
 * `spi3 opread` on the same code, unit, build and tones in the same run, the
 * record tears (R2 0.09 / -0.22, folds miss by 100-200 bins). EXP-12/15 read
 * them through opread with 40-420 Hz tones, which at 2.5-5 MS/s cover a
 * fraction of a period per record: the "INCOHERENT" verdict was the
 * instrument, exactly the possibility EXP-15 §6 left open. The mechanism of
 * the tearing itself (Stlkv, #18) is still not established.
 *
 * As before, what is stored is what was fitted, never the round number.

 *   0x06-0x09     INCOHERENT. Measured, and the records do not reproduce.
 *                 EXP-15 (2026-08-19) widened this from 0x08 alone: fitting all
 *                 four codes gives 1,231 / 1,595 / 1,350 / 1,550 S/s — a 30%
 *                 band — where a real ladder step is 2-2.5x, and 40 Hz lands on
 *                 bin 28 in ALL FOUR. Read-to-read spread is 144-309 bins on a

 *                 changes is not the device's rate; it is ours. Stlkv predicted
 *                 exactly this on issue #18 before it was run.
 *                 (His proposed MECHANISM — the fit returns our read cadence —
 *                 is NOT established: a round-trip opread takes ~800 ms, but
 *                 that is dominated by the hex dump over serial, and the SPI
 *                 burst at /256 is ~17.5 ms, which would predict ~58 kS/s.
 *                 Prediction confirmed, mechanism open.)
 *   0x0A-0x0C     UNMEASURABLE WITH OUR SOURCE. The ESP32 tops out near

 * Conflating the three would be the same error as treating a floating pin and
