/*
 * Host tests for the frequency estimator, driven by REAL BENCH RECORDS.
 *
 * This is the acceptance test EXP-13 asked for. It does not check the
 * estimator against a synthetic sine — a synthetic sine is exactly the case
 * that always worked. It runs the shipped code over 72 captures taken from
 * bench unit #1 on 2026-08-19, across two vertical ranges, three timebase
 * codes, five frequencies and seven amplitudes, with the signal generator
 * corrected (EXP-14) so the recorded drive frequency is DELIVERED rather than
 * merely commanded.
 *
 * The contract being tested is not "always answers". It is:
 *
 *   - when it answers, it is within 5% of the true drive;
 *   - it NEVER answers wrongly, which is what got the previous badge reverted;
 *   - it refuses on torn records rather than guessing.
 *
 * A refusal rate is reported, not asserted, so that improving coverage is
 * visible without loosening correctness.
