/*
 * Host tests for the scope horizontal (time) calibration.
 *
 * As with test_scope_cal.c, these do not second-guess bench numbers. They test
 * the PROPERTIES that keep this table from failing the way rate figures have
 * already failed on this project:
 *
 *   1. A code with no trustworthy rate returns exactly 0.0f, so a caller that
 *      forgets to check gets an obviously-zero frequency rather than a
 *      plausible one.
 *   2. Code 0x08 carries the EXP-63 rate (4,990,070 S/s, fold-tested on the
 *      acq path) and none of the three withdrawn artifacts (1.07 kS/s,
 *      1,660, 1,414/1,526), which were opread tearing; if someone re-enters
 *      one, this fails.
 *   3. Out-of-range codes refuse rather than wrap.
 *   4. Derived quantities really are derived — s/div from the rate and the
 *      renderer's samples-per-division, Hz from the rate and a period.
 *   5. Labels come from the measurement and are NOT the nominal timebase_table
 *      strings, which are a constant ~2.13x away.
