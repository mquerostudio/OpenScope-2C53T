"""MCP server: lets an LLM agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, …) drive an
OpenScope 2C53T through the same API as the `openscope` CLI.

    uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with mcp --with pyserial python -m openscope.mcp_server [--port P] [--level L]

Claude Code:
    claude mcp add openscope -- uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with mcp \
        --with pyserial --directory <repo>/tools/openscope_host python -m openscope.mcp_server

Safety: the debug shell can erase flash (`fwapply`, `flash wtest`), park the
FPGA or desynchronise acquisition. Whoever starts the server picks how much
of it the agent may reach (device.py owns the tables):

    --level readonly   READ_ONLY_SHELL only (the default)
    --level bench      + BENCH_SHELL: scope/acquisition settings and reads
    --level unsafe     the whole shell, for bench work with a human watching

scope_shell never sends NEVER_SHELL (see NEVER_SHELL_WHAT) at any level, and
scope_press refuses POWER at every level. Other presses are NOT filtered: they
can reach Settings > Startup on Boot (OK/LEFT/RIGHT erase and rewrite an MCU
flash sector), Settings > Firmware Update (OK reboots into DFU) and Settings >
FPGA SPI Scanner (OK starts a long SPI3/USART sweep that only the physical
POWER button stops). `--allow-raw-shell` is a deprecated alias for
`--level unsafe`.
